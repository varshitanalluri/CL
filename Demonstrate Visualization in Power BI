1. Bar Chart
Bar charts display data using horizontal bars, where each bar represents a different category, and its length reflects the value for that category. 
They are effective for comparing distinct items side-by-side, making them ideal for showing differences across categories like regions or products. 
This type of chart works well when category names are long, as they’re easier to read horizontally.

2. Column Chart
Column charts use vertical bars to represent data, with each bar showing the value for a specific category. 
They are particularly effective for showing trends or changes over time, as the vertical layout emphasizes progression and allows for easy comparison across time periods. 
Monthly sales data or quarterly performance metrics are great examples of column chart use cases.

3. Line Chart
Line charts use lines to connect individual data points, making them ideal for illustrating trends or changes over time. 
They are particularly effective for showing continuous data, such as monthly revenue or temperature variations, where it’s helpful to see both the individual data points and the overall trend. 
This type of chart emphasizes the shape and direction of change, which can help highlight patterns or anomalies.

4. Pie Chart
Pie charts represent data as slices of a circle, where each slice shows the proportion of a whole for a category. 
They are best used when you want to show the relative proportions of a small number of categories, like the market share of different brands. 
However, they can become hard to interpret with too many slices, so they’re most effective with fewer categories or to emphasize one dominant value.

5. Table
Tables display data in a structured, row-and-column format, making them ideal for showing detailed, precise values or when you need to present a large amount of information at once. 
Tables are less visually dynamic but provide exact values, which makes them suitable for reports that require specific data breakdowns, like financial reports or product lists.
