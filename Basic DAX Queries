Basic DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries are simple formulas and expressions used in Power BI, Excel Power Pivot, and SQL Server Analysis Services to analyze and manipulate data. 
DAX functions can perform calculations, create new columns and measures, and filter data. 

1. Basic Arithmetic Calculations
DAX allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
This is often used to create new measures or calculated columns, like total sales or profit. 
These simple calculations help to sum up or transform individual data points across rows or columns.

2. Aggregation Functions
Aggregation functions in DAX, like sum, average, minimum, and maximum, are used to calculate a single value from a set of values in a column. 
For example, you might use these functions to find the total revenue, the average order value, or the highest sales amount in a dataset.

3. Conditional Logic
DAX’s conditional logic, such as the “IF” function, allows you to apply custom rules to categorize data. 
This is useful for creating new columns or measures based on conditions. 
For example, you might categorize sales amounts as “High” or “Low” depending on a specific threshold.

4. Time Functions
Time functions in DAX simplify date-based calculations, like year-to-date, quarter-to-date, or prior-year comparisons. 
These functions help analyze trends over time by automatically adjusting date ranges based on the current context, making it easier to compare performance over different periods.

5. Using Relationships Across Tables
The RELATED function in DAX allows calculations that pull data from related tables. 
This is useful when working with multiple tables in a data model, as it enables you to bring in data fields from one table to another, 
supporting calculations that span across different tables, like combining product prices with sales quantities for revenue.
